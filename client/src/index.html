        <div class="explain">
          <p>The value of fossil fuel companies is derived from the amount of fuel they can sell. </p>

          <p>Citizens in democracies around the world want to burn less fossil fuels. </p>

          <p>If citizens win, the fossil fuel companies lose. </p>

          <h2> It's a question of when </h2>

          <div class="explain">
            <p>Everybody knows we will drastically reduce our fossil fuel consumption sooner or later. </p>

            <p>For fossil fuel companies, the later the better. For the rest of us, the sooner the better. </p>

            <p>The votes are on our side, but lobbying money isn't. </p>

            <p> So we change that. </p>
          </div>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2> We use the system </h2>

          <div class="explain">
            <p>The plan is simple: </p>

            <p>1. We create an investment fund that takes an aggressive short position against fossil fuel companies.</p>

            <p>2. We put money into lobbying governments to enact legislation that helps the climate and hurts the fossil fuel companies.</p>

            <p>3. When the pro-climate legislation is enacted and the value of fossil fuel companies tanks, the value of our short position goes up and we win back the money from lobbying.</p>

            <p>4. We win. The fossil fuel companies lose. No compromises.</p>

          </div>

        <section>
          <h2>Concentrating dispersed interests</h2>

          <div class="explain">
            <p> Fossil fuel companies have won thus far because they are a small, concentrated group of people with a lot to lose. </p>

            <p> We, the rest of the people, are many. What we have to lose is less tangible: part of each of our souls and the heritage of humanity.</p>

            <p>Tiltship is a plan to gather our disperesed interests together and distill them into a vehicle that makes change. </p>

            <p>A vehicle made of money.</p>
